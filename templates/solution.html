                This Angular application contains exactly three pages, all of 
                them linked from the menu about.  When you click on the 
                menu items, the page (and css, javascript etc.) will not
                reload.  Only the main section will be updated.  However, if 
                you for example try to press your browser reload right now,
                that will work too, so from an SEO point of view, this 
                application does indeed have 3 pages that will all be indexed
                individually.  In fact, you are most likely here because this
                page showed up in a Google search.
