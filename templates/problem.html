            Angular is the most popular HTML5 framework in the world. By
            default.  Most Angular applications are so-called HTML5 single-
            page applications.  This means that the basic HTML page is only 
            loaded once, and various part of the DOM tree is then manipulated
            as the user click on various links.
            </p>
            <p>
            Historically, the entire HTML page was reloaded when a user
            clicked on a link (an "a" tag).  The only exception was url's
            that included a hash sign (#).  Hash signs were used to index
            elements on the current page.  Because of this, the first HTML5
            single page applications used a trick, where the URL used hash
            signs to prevent the browser from reloading.  A url could for
            example be:
            </p>
            <p>
            http://whatever.com/#/page
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
